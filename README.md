# Color Count for Runway Images
## Overview
This machine learning project utilizes PyTorch and DeepLabV3 to analyze runway images and count the most trending colors in fashion. It processes images, extracts color information, and saves the results in a bar graph, allowing you to easily see the colors used and their frequency.
