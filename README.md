# Color Count for Runway Images
## Overview
This machine learning project utilizes PyTorch and DeepLabV3 to analyze runway images and count the most trending colors in them. It processes images, extracts color information, and visualizes the results in a bar graph, allowing you to easily see the colors used and their frequency.

Using Pytorch and Deeplabv3 to count trending colors in fashion, returning a bar graph to see the most used color
